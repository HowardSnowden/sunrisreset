About.create({what:"Technically speaking, a Monolithic Cloud Parade would be a large, powerful, and intractably indivisible and uniform public procession celebrating masses of condensed water vapor.
Practically speaking, Monolithic Cloud Parade is a musical adventure began on a whim, a Casio keyboard purchased in 7th grade and stashed away until after college, and a name formed in the middle of a long drive through western states with the belief that the best band names have three names and don’t start with 'the.' It continued through various iterations, fueled by self-determination, Craigslist, terrible self-promotion, friendship, and fan adoration in the vein of '¡My cat and me can't stop to listen this song!' (Username: degas, thesixtyone.com/monolithiccloudparade/).The first time Monolithic Cloud Parade died it was due to impending future endeavors, the time suck of full-time jobs and master’s degrees, and general inertia. The first time Monolithic Cloud Parade came back to life it was a very brief occurrence of birthday party and funship to celebrate songs of time gone by. The second time Monolithic Cloud Parade came back to life was not at all, for a change of identity was requested and therefore Monolithic Cloud Parade finally died.", where:'i dunno', why:'I dunno', when: 'I dunno', who:'i dunno', how:'i dunno'})
